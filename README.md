# My Projects

This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, ranging from data analysis and visualization to machine learning and web development. Below is a brief description of each project, along with a link to the corresponding repository.

## [Sea Level Prediction](https://github.com/username/sea-level-prediction)

A machine learning project that predicts sea level rise based on historical data. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis)

A natural language processing project that performs sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning algorithms. The project involves data pre-processing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation.

## [Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/username/stock-price-prediction)

A time series analysis project that predicts stock prices using historical data. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and back testing.

## [Web Scraping](https://github.com/username/web-scraping)

A web scraping project that extracts data from websites using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. The project involves identifying target websites, designing the scraping algorithm, and handling data cleaning and pre-processing.

## [Data Visualization](https://github.com/username/data-visualization)

A data visualization project that creates interactive plots and charts using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The project involves identifying target data sets, designing the visualization, and implementing user interactivity.

Feel free to explore each project repository for more details and code samples!
