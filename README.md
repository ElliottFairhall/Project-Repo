## Python Projects

### Stock-Analysis-Tool

This project demonstrates various financial analysis techniques using Python and using Streamlit to visualise this information into an informative and user-friendly experience. This project utilizes modules such as yfinance, matplotlib, and VaderSentiment to analyse stocks and extract news articles related to a range of stock tickers. 

The project creates visualizations of historical stock data, calculates returns, and analyses news article sentiment to gain a better understanding of the performance of stocks.

### Interactive-Sentiment-Analysis

This project looks to perform sentiment analysis on user-provided text and presents the results in a range of charts and visuals. 

The application determines the overall sentiment of the text, calculates a polarity and subjectivity score, identifies and extracts named entities, and provides insights into the top 10 keywords discussed in the input text.

### Forum-Page-Views-Analysis

This project is a simple data analysis application built using the Python programming language and the Streamlit framework. The application visualises the daily page views of the freecodeCamp forum from 2016 to 2019. 

The user can select the level of aggregation of the data, whether daily, monthly, or yearly, and view the data in a range of diffrent ways.

### Iris-Flower-Prediction

This project is a machine learning application for predicting the type of iris based on measurements of its petal and sepal length and width. 

Using modules such as sklearn, numpy, and pandas, the model is able to accurately classify Irises into one of three species based on their physical characteristics. 

The project showcases the possibilities with machine learning and provides interactivity to the end-user.

## Azure Projects

### Google-Drive-to-Azure-Blob-Storage

This project provides an automated backup solution for Google Drive that utilizes Azure services to provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for migrating files from Google Drive to Azure Blob Storage. 

The solution uses the Google Drive API to access files and folders in Google Drive and transfers these files to a respective Azure Blob Storage to store the backup data.  The project also utilises other Azure technologies to support security and governance such as Azure Key Vault and Events Hub to security store secrets and keys as well as provide detailed log handling.
